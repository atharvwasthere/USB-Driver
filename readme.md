# USB Driver Development Guide

## Overview
This project provides a USB driver written in C for Linux systems. It covers the essential steps for driver registration, device identification, handling USB requests, and managing data transfers. The implementation follows the Linux kernel's USB driver API standards.

## Features
- USB driver registration and initialization.
- Device identification using vendor and product IDs.
- Data transfer support (control, bulk, interrupt, and isochronous).
- Power management (suspend and resume operations).
- Error handling and debugging support.

## Prerequisites
- Linux system with kernel headers installed.
- Basic knowledge of C programming and Linux kernel modules.
- USB device for testing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. Build the driver:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Load the driver:
   ```bash
   sudo insmod usb_driver.ko
   ```

4. Verify the driver is loaded:

```bash
   lsmod | grep usb_driver
   ```

## Usage
- Connect the USB device.
- Use `dmesg` or `tail -f /var/log/syslog` to check driver logs.
- Perform data transfer operations (read/write) through the driver interface.

## Power Management
The driver supports suspend and resume callbacks to handle power state transitions:
```c
int (*suspend)(struct usb_interface *intf, pm_message_t message);
int (*resume)(struct usb_interface *intf);
```

## Error Handling
- Implements error checks on URB submission.
- Logs errors for debugging using `dev_err()` and `printk()`.
